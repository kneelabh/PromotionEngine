Create a Promotion Engine
Scenerios:
1. Engine can have multiple promotion types with a flexibility of expansion
2. Calculation of items based on the SKU cost and running promotion 
3. Promotion are mutually exclusive

Scope of improvement:
Use of JSON parser to pull Promotion Types and Cost from JSON file and use it in a stratagy pattern. I have not used any third party libraries in the code as mentioned in the instructions.
